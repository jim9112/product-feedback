This is a project built using a design from Front End Mentor. Provided a design file and a JSON file with data to use, the goal was to create a project feedback appliction. I created this application using Next.JS, Tailwind CSS, and Recoil.JS. You have the ability to add feedback, comment on feedback, reply to other comments, "like" feedback, and to sort and filter the feedback that is displayed. The data does not persist so any added comments will disapear on refresh. Enjoy!!
